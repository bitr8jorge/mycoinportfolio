My Coin Portfolio is a **web portfolio** for your cryptocurrency needs. 
MCP follows a holistic approach for organising your cryptocurrency portfolio. 
The webpage acts as an "observatory" for your portfolio's performance and for news around cryptocurrency.

- MCP utilises the powerful CoinMarketCap API to bring you the latest prices in real time. 
- MCP is responsive and optimised for mobile view. 
- MCP is developed using HTML, PHP, and Javascript.

## Setup

1. Download the 2 files: `index.php` and `config.php` That's the only files you need :)
2. Edit the `config.php` file using a text editor that supports PHP. I suggest [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (they are free). There are detailed instructions on how to register your coins, inside the `config.php` file.
3. Upload those 2 files to your web server. If you do not own one, you can get free web hosting (with PHP enabled) from several sites. I suggest [000webhost.com](https://www.000webhost.com).
4. That's it. Enjoy!

# 5 Tabs = Crypto Power

My Coin Portfolio consists of 5 tabs: 
1. **My Summary**
2. **My Coin Portfolio**
3. **My Watchlist**
4. **News**
5. **Community Posts**

## 1. My Summary

A summary of your portfolio performance and your investments in percentages. 
This is a "screenshot" of your portfolio, only in percentages, in case you want to share it online without revealing how much you have invested.

The portfolio performace is calculated based the proportion of the profit or loss compared to the total investment.

The pie chart is automatically generated after you register your coins.

## 2. My Coins Portfolio

This is the main tab (apparently :P ) where all your cryptocurrency investments are analysed. 
Here you will find your coins, how much you invested, how much they worth right now, and if you are profiting or losing and how much exactly. 

The investments that you've made are analysed to Coin Investment, Fees (exchange etc.), and Mining Expenses.
The sum of all Coin Investments is your total Coin Investment. 
This sum is subtracted from the Gross Investment (that you register manually) and there you have the Exchange Fees etc. 
The Mining Expenses - if any - are registered manually.

(PS. To find each coin's Coin ID from CoinMarketCap [check here](https://ibb.co/gcG9Wv).)

## 3. My Watchlist

At this tab, you get many info on coins and tokens that interest you. 
This might have been coins that you bought in the past or coins that you would like to buy in the future. 
All the info are coming from CoinMarketCap.

At this tab, you can also enter Website and Whitepaper URLs for your preferred coins, so that you can access them faster.
