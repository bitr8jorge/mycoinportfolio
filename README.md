# 5 Tabs = Crypto Power

My Crypto Portfolio consists of 5 tabs: 
1. **My Summary**
2. **My Crypto Portfolio**
3. **My Watchlist**
4. **News**
5. **Community Posts**

## 1. My Summary

A summary of your portfolio performance and your investments, only in percentages. 
This is a "screenshot" of your portfolio, only in percentages, in case you want to share it online without revealing how much you have invested.

The portfolio performace is calculated based the profit or loss / total investment.

The pie chart is automatically generated after you register your coins.

## 2. My Crypto Portfolio

This is the main tab (apparently) where all your cryptocurrency investments are analysed. 
Here you will find your coins and tokens, how much you invested, how much they worth right now, and if you are profiting or losing and how much exactly. 

The investments that you've made are analysed to crypto investments, fees (exchange etc.), and mining expenses.
The sum of current crypto balances is your crypto investment. 
This sum is subtracted from the gross, total investment (that you register manually) and there you have the exchange fees etc. 
The mining expenses - if any - are registered manually.

## 3. My Watchlist

At this tab, you get many info on coins and tokens that interest you. 
This might have been coins that you bought in the past or coins that you would like to buy in the future. 
All the info are coming from CoinMarketCap.

At this tab, you can also enter Website and Whitepaper URLs for your preferred cryptos, so that you can access them faster.
